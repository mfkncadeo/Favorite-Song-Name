    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>[Intro]</h4>
        (I’m working on dying)<br>
        Woo, woo, woo-woo<br>
        Woo, woo, woo-woo<br>
        Woo, woo, woo-woo<br>
        Woo, woo, woo-woo (Lil Uzi)<br>

        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        I just brought a new Bentley coupe (Yeah)<br>
        Fifty bands, other pocket, 62<br>
        That bitch you with, she ain't new (New)<br>
        I made it rain, woo, where's the roof? (Roof)<br>
        Not talking money, what's your use?<br>
        Better get yo' bitch, she on the loose (Loose)<br>
        You got crash dummies that ain't gon' shoot (Shoot)<br>
        I get trap money in a Dickie's suit<br>

        <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
        Drumroll, jumbo bullets put his ass in a soup<br>
        I've been cooking up all night, I'm done by noon<br>
        Gucci shirt, Gucci belt, Gucci pants, yeah, Gucci on my boots<br>
        Get ya man, he's a bitch, he don't know I got my tool<br>
        Handy Manny, rubber band it, in the cut, need a bandage<br>
        Fuck her once, then abandon, Lil Uzi, I'm a bandit<br>
        Self-coolin' choppеr, Igloo FN, kinda quiet, but got damage<br>
        Thirty hittin', like a xanny<br>
        I'm a grizzly, likе the salmon (Let's go, let's go)<br>
        To get in my building, you need a laminate<br>
        Lil Uzi pull up in all matte Lamby (skrrt)<br>
        You know, know that I am never lackin'<br>
        Peanut butter my seats, so they never jammin'<br>
        Took advantage over every disadvantage<br>
        Got a crib on the beach so I'm water landin'<br>
        Got a crib on the beach so I water landed<br>
        Change the engine, my Bentley, it's hard to handle (Beep, beep)<br>
        <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
        I just brought a new Bentley coupe (Yeah)<br>

        I made it rain, woo, where's the roof?<br>
        Not talking money, what's your use?<br>
        Better get yo' bitch, she on the loose<br>
        You got crash dummies that ain't gon' shoot<br>
        I get fast money in a suit<br>

        <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
        Woah, I'm off shrooms (Woah)<br>
        I can see everything on the moon (On the moon)<br>

        Uh, five girls with me, look like Sailor Moon (Sailor Moon)<br>
        Uh, fucked her last December, her name June (Her name June)<br>
